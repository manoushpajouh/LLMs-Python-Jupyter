# About The Project

These are two LLMs I developed while I studied abroad at Charles University in Prague, Czechia and took an Artificial Intelligence course.
Both projects are originally developed with Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab, but the python file is what is in the GitHub. 
To view the notebook itself, please see the links attached at the top of the individual files to be redirected to the respective notebook. 

# Built With

HuggingFace
PyTorch/PyTorch Lightning

# Usage

To run the code, see the jupyter notebook linked at the top of each file.
